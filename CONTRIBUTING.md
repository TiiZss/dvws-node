# Contributing to DVWS-Node

Thank you for your interest in contributing to DVWS-Node! We welcome contributions that help improve the educational value of this project.

## How to Contribute

1.  **Fork the repository** on GitHub.
2.  **Clone your fork** locally.
3.  **Create a new branch** for your feature or fix.
4.  **Implement your changes**.
    *   If adding a new vulnerability, ensure it is documented in the `README.md` and `CHANGELOG.md`.
    *   If fixing a bug in the infrastructure, ensure it doesn't accidentally patch an intended vulnerability.
5.  **Commit your changes** with clear messages.
6.  **Push to your fork** and submit a **Pull Request**.

## Guidelines

-   **Keep it Vulnerable**: The primary goal is education. Do not fix the security flaws unless they break the application infrastructure.
-   **Documentation**: Explain how the new vulnerability works or how to exploit it (update the Wiki/Cheatsheet if possible).
-   **Code Style**: Try to follow the existing coding style (Standard JS).

## Reporting Issues

If you find a bug that prevents the application from running, please open a standard GitHub issue.
